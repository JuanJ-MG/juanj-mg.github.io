## Project Overview

This project formulates and solves a **supply chain network optimization problem** focused on determining optimal product flows across a multi-echelon distribution system. The goal is to **minimize total transportation cost** while satisfying supply, demand, and capacity constraints.

The model captures a realistic logistics setting involving **suppliers**, **distribution centers (warehouses)**, and **customers**, and is solved using **linear programming** techniques.

---

## Problem Description

The supply chain consists of:

- Multiple **suppliers** with limited production capacity  
- Multiple **distribution centers (DCs)** with throughput capacity limits  
- Multiple **customers** with fixed demand requirements  

Products flow from suppliers to distribution centers, and then from distribution centers to customers. Each transportation link incurs a cost proportional to the shipped quantity.

The key decision is determining **how much product should flow on each link** in order to minimize total cost while meeting all operational constraints.

---

## Decision Variables

- \( x_{i,j} \): quantity shipped from supplier \( i \) to distribution center \( j \)
- \( y_{j,k} \): quantity shipped from distribution center \( j \) to customer \( k \)

---

## Objective Function

Minimize the total transportation cost across the supply chain:

\[
\min \sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x_{i,j} + \sum_{j,k} c_{jk} y_{j,k}
\]

where:
- \( c_{ij} \) is the cost from supplier \( i \) to DC \( j \)
- \( c_{jk} \) is the cost from DC \( j \) to customer \( k \)

---

## Constraints

### Supply Capacity
Each supplier cannot ship more than its available capacity:
\[
\sum_j x_{i,j} \le \text{Supply}_i
\]

### Distribution Center Flow Conservation
Inbound flow equals outbound flow at each distribution center:
\[
\sum_i x_{i,j} = \sum_k y_{j,k}
\]

### Distribution Center Capacity
Total flow through each DC is limited:
\[
\sum_i x_{i,j} \le \text{Capacity}_j
\]

### Demand Satisfaction
Each customer’s demand must be fully met:
\[
\sum_j y_{j,k} = \text{Demand}_k
\]

## Model Type and Methodology

- **Problem type:** Multi-echelon supply chain optimization  
- **Formulation:** Linear Programming (LP)  
- **Structure:** Network flow–based model  
- **Solution approach:** Optimization using Python and a mathematical programming solver  

This formulation aligns closely with classical **transportation and minimum-cost flow models** widely used in logistics and operations planning.

---

## Outputs and Insights

The optimized solution provides:
- Optimal shipment quantities between all supply chain nodes  
- Identification of which suppliers serve which customers (via DCs)  
- Minimum achievable total transportation cost  

The results can be used to support:
- Tactical distribution planning  
- Cost reduction analysis  
- Capacity utilization insights  

---

## Extensions and Future Work

Potential extensions of this model include:
- Fixed facility opening costs (network design)
- Multi-period planning
- Demand uncertainty and stochastic optimization
- Carbon or sustainability constraints

## Tools and Technologies

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Linear Programming solvers  
- Pandas / NumPy for data handling

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how optimization models can be used to support **data-driven decision-making in supply chain logistics**, providing both cost savings and operational clarity in complex distribution networks.
