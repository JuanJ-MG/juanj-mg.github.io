## Overview

This paper investigates **manufacturing techniques for candy-type solid rocket propellants** under the challenging conditions of a **humid, high-altitude mountain climate**. Such environments introduce variability in material behavior, curing processes, and final propellant performance, which can significantly impact rocket engine reliability.

The work focuses on identifying practical process adaptations that enable consistent propellant production despite environmental constraints.

## Methodology

The study combines:

- **Experimental manufacturing trials** of candy-type solid propellant formulations
- Observation of **environmental effects**, including humidity and temperature fluctuations
- Process adjustments related to mixing, casting, curing, and storage
- Comparative evaluation of propellant quality and consistency under different manufacturing conditions

The approach emphasizes hands-on experimentation and empirical assessment of manufacturing robustness.
