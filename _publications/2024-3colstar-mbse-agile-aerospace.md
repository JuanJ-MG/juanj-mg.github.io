## Overview

This paper proposes a structured approach for **preliminary satellite system design** by integrating **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)** with **Agile methodologies**. The goal is to improve early-phase system definition by combining MBSE’s rigor (traceability, architecture, requirements consistency) with Agile’s iterative planning and rapid feedback cycles.

The framework is demonstrated through an application to the **3ColStar mission**, showing how teams can progress from mission goals to an initial system architecture while maintaining clear alignment between stakeholder needs, engineering requirements, and design decisions.

---

## Methodology

The proposed approach combines:

- **MBSE artifacts** to define and maintain consistency across mission objectives, requirements, and system architecture
- **Agile practices** to support iterative development cycles, incremental refinement, and continuous validation of design decisions
- A mission-driven workflow that translates stakeholder objectives into system-level design elements and trade study inputs

This integration supports repeatable early-stage design processes and helps teams manage complexity and coordination across subsystems.

---

## Key Contributions

This paper contributes by:

- Providing a practical, integrated **MBSE–Agile workflow** for early satellite design
- Demonstrating how iterative development can be combined with MBSE traceability without losing engineering rigor
- Presenting the **3ColStar mission** as a concrete case study to illustrate how the approach is implemented in practice
- Offering a template-like process that can be adapted for other small satellite missions and early-stage aerospace system development efforts

---

## Application Context

While the case study is a small satellite mission, the proposed integration is applicable to broader aerospace systems where teams must balance:

- fast iteration and evolving requirements
- multidisciplinary coordination
- documentation and traceability needs
- architecture and interface definition in early phases
