## Overview

This paper presents the **conceptual design of a Martian ice sample return mission**, motivated by the scientific value of subsurface ice for understanding Mars’ climate history, astrobiological potential, and future in-situ resource utilization (ISRU).

The work focuses on defining a feasible end-to-end mission architecture capable of acquiring, storing, and returning Martian ice samples to Earth while respecting constraints on mass, power, propulsion, and mission risk.

---

## Methodology

The mission design process integrates:

- **System-level mission architecture definition**, including launch, cruise, Mars operations, ascent, and Earth return
- **Subsystem trade studies** covering propulsion, power, thermal control, structures, and sample handling
- **Mass and power budgeting** to evaluate feasibility under realistic spacecraft constraints
- Preliminary trajectory and mission phase analysis to assess operational timelines and risks

Design decisions are evaluated using classical aerospace systems engineering principles and comparative trade analyses.

## Key Contributions

The paper contributes by:

- Proposing a complete **conceptual architecture** for a Martian ice sample return mission
- Identifying key **design drivers and bottlenecks**, including mass growth, thermal requirements, and sample preservation
- Demonstrating the feasibility of ice sample return under constrained mission resources
- Providing a structured framework for early-phase mission design applicable to future Mars exploration concepts

---

## Application Context

Although focused on Mars exploration, the design approach is broadly applicable to:

- Sample return missions to other planetary bodies
- Cryogenic or volatile sample handling missions
- Early-phase mission concept development for complex aerospace systems
