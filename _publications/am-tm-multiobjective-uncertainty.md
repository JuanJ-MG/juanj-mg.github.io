## Overview

This paper develops a **multi-objective optimization framework** to study the tradeoffs between **additive manufacturing (AM)** and **traditional manufacturing (TM)** technologies when both **cost and production time** are considered simultaneously.

The model captures key operational realities faced by manufacturers, including **capacity limits, setup costs, economies of scale, and lead times**, and evaluates how optimal technology selection changes as demand increases.

---

## Methodology

The framework combines:

- A **multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)** formulation using the ε-constraint method  
- Two alternative representations of **economies of scale** (incremental discounts and bulk pricing brackets)  
- **Monte Carlo simulation** to capture uncertainty in demand, processing times, setup costs, and machine capacity  

The approach generates **Pareto frontiers** that describe cost–time tradeoffs across a wide range of operating conditions.

## Key Contributions

The paper makes several contributions to the additive manufacturing and operations research literature:

- Quantifies when AM and TM dominate under different **demand and time-pressure regimes**
- Explicitly models **economies of scale** for both AM and TM technologies
- Incorporates **lead time effects** that significantly alter technology dominance
- Introduces **probability-of-exceedance analysis** to evaluate cost risk under uncertainty

## Application Context

Although motivated by **aerospace spare-parts production**, the framework is broadly applicable to manufacturing systems where firms must balance **responsiveness, cost efficiency, and uncertainty** when selecting production technologies.

---

## Status

This manuscript is currently **in preparation** and is based on the author’s **M.S. thesis in Industrial and Systems Engineering**.
