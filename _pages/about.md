Hello! I’m **Juan Mejia**.

I am currently and **Industrial Engineer** at **Textron Aviation** (Kansas), with a background in **Aerospace Engineering** and an **M.S. in Industrial & Systems Engineering**. I am currently preparing applications for a **PhD in Aerospace Engineering**, with research interests centered on **Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC)**, **Space logistics**, **Systems Engineering**, and **AI-enabled systems engineering**.

My academic and professional work lies at the intersection of aerospace systems, optimization, and intelligent decision-making, with a particular interest in applying rigorous systems methodologies to complex, multi-domain aerospace problems.

## Research Interests

My primary research interests include:

- **Space logistics and infrastructure**, including mission planning, resource allocation, and operational architectures  
- **Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC)** for spacecraft and autonomous aerospace systems    
- **Optimization and control**, including MILP, multi-objective, stochastic, and robust methods  
- **Artificial intelligence and machine learning** for decision support, autonomy, and system-level optimization  
- **Complex systems analysis** spanning design, operations, and lifecycle considerations
- **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)** and digital engineering for aerospace systems
